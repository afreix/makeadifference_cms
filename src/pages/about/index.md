## _Our Mission is to support Folks Transition from the "street corner" to a stable living environment_

We fully understand most people struggle with how to better support the homeless community.   Our approach is to get to the know the individual first and then build a plan to support each individual/family needs which will systematically transition them from a ???? to permanent housing they can all their own.  It’s my firm belief that we can make a difference in people’s live if we 

The various services our organization offers is:

1. Early on in the process of developing a plan and a set of goals, and actions required to meet their plan; we support them in their ongoing search for employment 
2. Financial support transition to permanent housing usually through paying for the entire or partial downpayment....we expect them to pay their initial and future monthly rent. 
3. Providing Transportation to get back and forth to work.  This could look like purchasing a bike, using Uber until ready to purchase other form of transportation, or.....
4. Throughout this entire process we assign a mentor to guide and teach them necessary skills to stay out of homelessness....like my wife likes to say...Teach them how to fish!!!  

### Although the process sounds laborious, we have got to remember most, if not all, people don't want to be homeless and usually a number of events occurred at about the same time to know them off their feet.

This organization is looking for individuals/families who are willing and able to do what is necessary to implement their plan/goals
