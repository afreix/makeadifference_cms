  Not only great conversation but also a bit of chance, or as James likes to
  say....God, brought James any myself together.  I was on a dinner run with
  Feeding Friends (local nonprofit) and on our final stop I turned around and
  James was standing there asking for some boots for an interview the next day. 
  One thing lead to another and 10 minutes later James and I were exchanging
  phone numbers.
